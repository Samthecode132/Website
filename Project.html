We are willing to help encourage women to gain the oppertunty to have their own profession. Over the years, women were not accepted into getting a career just because of their gender. Women are viewed as weak and not superior and it is our goal to change that.</font>

<center><h3>Why?</p></center></h3>
We are concerned with how our community treeats women horribly and does not allow them to have the same oppertunities and equalities as men. Women are taking care of their children at home while their husbands work in buisness. We believe that women should have the right to work in jobs that supports them financially and makes them feel stronger. Women around the globe should believe that they are powerful.</font>

<center><h3>Our Team</center></p></h3>

<font face="Arial">We are four women working in tech at a summer immersion program called Girls Who Code. We are working on improving our economy through the use of technology. It is our duty on this website to give women a possibility of having a career.</font>

  <font face="Arial">"Like many students of Miami-Dade County, my parents are not from the United States. My parents were born in Argentina and immigrated to the United States when they finished their high school in Buenos Aires in order to have a better life in this great country. Between the process of assimilating to a new country, my mom never learned about all the job opportunities in Miami, and didn't have many resources or advice available. That's why I decided to be part of this team, to inspire women and help open the doors of career success and opportunity. No one deserves to be misinformed."</font>

    <font face="Arial">"At sixteen years old, I developed a passion for learning and technology. Starting when I taught my little sister how to use our family laptop; Girls Who Code has taught me how to share my knowledge with others towards a better future. This experience has has expanded my knowledge in developing responsive websites, and advanced web development with Girls Who Code. Not only have I developed this love for learning, but have also built functioning robots with my grandfather, and developed websites for mental health awareness. I believe all women can be prosperous and empowered to expand their knowledge. Being apart of Girls Who Code team is allowing me to benefit other women in the development of their careers."
